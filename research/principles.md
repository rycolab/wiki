# General Principles of Academic Research 
### &mdash; Ryan

So, you’ve decided to write a paper with me. Great! Here is a list of my values. I encourage you to read them with a careful eye, as I try to embody them in my research activities. I welcome and encourage discussion of these values. However, if you do disagree with something I’ve written here, I expect you to bring it up with me before we start working together to avoid future misunderstandings. I also wish to emphasize that I take the principles below incredibly seriously.


## On Research Quality 

Quality is the primary concern when it comes to scientific publications. However, the word quality means different things to different people. This section seeks to explain what quality means to me, and by extension, to my lab. 

A scientific work of high quality has the following attributes:
* The work is technically correct;
* The experiments are well designed, and the experimental comparisons show what the authors claim they do;
    * Proper statistical methods for the problem being considered are utilized;
* The work engages fairly with the previous work in the relevant area;
* The ideas in the paper are expressed clearly and coherently—that is to say, clarity of thought and clarity of verbal expression matter a great deal to me.

A scientific work of high quality does not need any of the following attributes:
* The work is likely to get a lot of citations;
* The work is on a popular topic;
* The work describes a method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a task;
* The work is “non-incremental”. 



## On Ethical Research

Research must be conducted in an ethical manner. At an absolute minimum, this means following the rules of your university. For ETHZ’s policy, see the following website (https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/organisation/boards-university-groups-commissions/ethics-commission.html). You must also follow the ethical guidelines of the organization you are publishing with. The ACL follows the ACM’s guidelines; see (https://ethics.acm.org/). I expect all papers to have a section entitled “Ethical Consideration,” which overviews the ethical concerns of the work. 


## On Contributing to a Paper

I expect all authors to be equally invested in the research, understand the work completely, be able to answer detailed questions about the work, and be able to defend the work from criticism. While it is a fact that not all authors will be able to contribute equally in most collaborations, e.g., it’s often the case that it makes the most sense for one person to do the coding alone, I believe we should strive for equality where possible. And, while I recognize that true equality in the level of contribution is never possible, and, indeed, distinctions in the degree of contribution are often reflected in the author ordering in NLP and ML conference papers, I believe we should still strive for it.[^1] The reasoning behind this is that the paper belongs to all its authors. Indeed, if the paper were found to be invalid, all authors are equally responsible. Thus, in my view, it follows that we should strive to take equal ownership of our work.

[^1]: In some disciplines, e.g., mathematics and theoretical computer science, author order is determined alphabetically by last name; the primary distinction is whether or not enough work was done for an author to be on the paper at all. 


Next, I also believe it is important to recognize that contributions also often take different forms. Some authors do more coding, more of the literature review, more of the writing, or more of the derivations and proofs. The nature of the contribution does not a-priori determine the contribution’s importance. For instance, a collaborator who performs a really great literature review that entails reading and summarizing hundreds of papers may in fact deserve to be viewed as having contributed more to the paper than the person who did the coding.

The above paragraph is more of a vibe than a policy. So, to be more concrete, I will list a few things that are required to do:
* You must contribute to a paper to be an author. It follows that trying to argue for authorship because you advise or fund a co-author of the paper is not okay;[^2]
* You must carefully read and check the final version of the paper before publication—every author is responsible for checking the correctness of the paper (to the extent they are able to);
* You must accept that there are different types of contributions that warrant authorship, e.g., arguing that the idea was really yours, and the person who implemented the work was “just coding” it, is not okay;
* You must share the fundamental aspects of the research, e.g., code, data, LaTeX source, with your co-authors; 
* You must inform your co-authors of changes regarding the publication status of the paper, e.g. you must tell your co-authors if you submit the paper for publication, and you must make those decisions with the consensus of the entire author list.

[^2]: I have broken off many a collaboration with senior researchers who think their past achievements warrant authorship on work done by others. It’s unacceptable.



A simple maxim I use to summarize the above is that publication makes permanent. Once a paper is published, it will be permanently (and in many cases publicly) available for the world to read. Thus, the authors all bear responsibility for the scientific content of the work forever. Any action that inhibits your co-authors from ensuring the quality of the paper, or any systematic failure on your part to help in that goal is not great. However, the above isn’t to say that mistakes don’t happen—they do, and frequently. I’ve made quite a few mistakes ranging from typos in a derivation to an incorrect algorithm. A good researcher simultaneously embraces the humanity of the research process, and thus accepts that all research papers will be imperfect to some degree, and the fact that we should respect the sincerity and gravitas of scientific publication, and thus try our best to avoid mistakes. 


## On Author Ordering

Author ordering is complicated and there are many competing concerns. There is often not one correct author order, and the best strategy is to try to reach a consensus. For instance, one could adopt a strategy in close, enduring collaborations, where you and your collaborator alternate who receives first authorship. In some disciplines, author ordering can affect promotions and the implicit allocation of credit. Thus, we should strive to be mindful of this. Consider a situation where you regularly co-author with a colleague and you always do 51% of the work and the colleague does 49%. In a discipline where substantially more credit is given to the first author than the second, e.g., in NLP, it is unfair that you always claim the first authorship. This is the same sense in which the electoral college in the United States does not always lead to fair representation. The best strategy, in my experience, is to discuss author ordering earlier and often with your co-authors so there are no hard feelings.


## On Disagreement

There must always be room for reasonable people to disagree. My PhD advisor, Jason Eisner, used to (and probably still does) quip that an academic is a person who has an impolite amount to say on a topic, so they have to write a paper about it. In other words, most academics are opinionated—often with good reason. Because it can be hard to get opinionated people to all agree, there must be some wiggle room in coming to a consensus. We should all be prepared to hedge with respect to our interpretation of the results where we feel comfortable, and a paper should try to accept a variety of interpretations of the data. In cases of deep-seated disagreements, the best approach is to declare all points of view in the paper and place appropriate caveats. In the case that two co-authors have a disagreement they cannot resolve with verbiage in the paper, the paper cannot be published.[^3]

[^3]: This is an unfortunate outcome, which should be avoided where possible.
