# Planning a Submission

When you are planning a new submission it is important that you fill in the [upcoming submission doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I30w-oT6v-WiEimBvvp5CY-_kSpT-8eyqnuncpqPzUI/edit#gid=0) with the relevant informations about your paper: the title, the venue, the submission deadline and the authors. You should also enter the current status of your paper (from 1-'pipedream' to 6-'accepted') and keep the status up to date while the project develops. If you have not made one yet, make a new public Zulip channel with all the co-authors. The  channel should be named as follows: 'Ï€-project name'.

Usually it is a good idea to start writing your paper from an early stage. Download the style files from the website of the conference/journal that you want to submit to, create a new [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) ducument, and make sure that every co-author has acces to it. Once you have created the new document, you should add the link to the upcoming submissions doc. 

Make sure that all the co-authors agree on key aspects like the author ordering and the venue from an early stage.
