# Fellowships 

## PhD Fellowships

Students who wish to do a PhD at ETH Zürich have many different funding opportunities. This page details fellowships that are awarded ad personam, i.e., they are awarded to the student, rather than the advisor. The most important fellowships are listed below. The application deadline usually opens during late summer or early fall. A short summary is provided under each fellowship, but please visit the individual websites for information specific to each program.

### [CLS Doctoral Program](https://learning-systems.org/basics)

The Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS) offers a PhD fellowship where students have an advisor from ETH and one from the Max Plank Institute. Each fellowship holder necessarily has an advisor from one institution and a co-advisor from the other. The student spends the majority of their PhD at the advisor's location, but they must also spend at least one year at the co-advisor's institution.
The CLS covers 50% of the student's funding for the first three years of the doctoral program. The remaining 50% is split between the advisor and co-advisor. Traditionally, the advisor pays the remaining 50% during those months that the student is at the advisor's institution and the co-advisor pays for the remaining 50% during those months that the student is at the co-advisor's institution.
Applicants to the fellowship are required to hold or to be about to complete a Master's degree in a relevant field. Proof of English language proficiency is also required.


### [CYD Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/research/funding/epfl-programmes/cyd/cyd-phd/)

The Cyber-Defense Campus (CYD) offers a fully funded four-year PhD fellowship. Despite the website being hosted at EPFL, the fellowship is equally applicable to students wishing to study at ETH Zürich. The fellowship provides salary, research, and conference allowances. 
Applicants must *already* be enrolled in the doctoral program at ETH Zürich to apply.

### [ETH AI Center Doctoral Fellowship](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs/phd-fellowships.html)

The ETH AI Center offers a fellowship program for doctoral students that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration. The fellowship involves co-supervision by two faculty members from different departments, in an attempt to foster interdisciplinary exchange. 
Applicants are expected to have a strong academic background and to hold a Master's degree in a relevant field, such as computer science or applied mathematics.

### [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc)

The European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) offers a PhD program that promotes collaboration across european institutions. 
The program is split into two separate tracks. In the academic track, students are supervised by two advisors who are both ELLIS fellows at two different european institutions. In the industry track, students will be supervised by an academic advisor and by an advisor in industry. Both tracks require the fellow to spend a period of 6 months in the secondary institution. 
Interested applicants can apply to the central application process when they are not yet enrolled in a PhD program. At most institutions, applicants are expected to hold a Master's degree.
Alternatively, ELLIS fellows may nominate students that are already enrolled in a PhD program and are working with them to become ELLIS PhD students. These students must have already published a first-author paper in one of the leading ML conferences.
ELLIS provides very little financial support for students so this is not a means for students to fund themselves.

## Postdoctoral Fellowships

The [CYD](https://www.epfl.ch/research/funding/epfl-programmes/cyd/cyd-postdoc/), [AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs/postdoc-fellowships.html), and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) also offer equivalent fellowships for prospective post-doctoral fellows.
