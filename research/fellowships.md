# Fellowships 

## PhD Fellowships

Master students interested in doing a PhD are encouraged to apply to PhD fellowships. This not only increases interorganizational collaboration and the interdisciplinary focus of their research, but also allows sharing the funding between the fellowship organization and Rycolab.

ETH students can apply to many different fellowships, some of which are listed below. Applications deadline usually open during late summer or early fall. Visit individual websites for information specific to each program.

### [CLS Doctoral Program](https://learning-systems.org/basics)

The Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS) offers a PhD fellowship where students have an advisor from ETH and one from the Max Plank institute. The program involves spending a year-long exchange in the co-advisor location.

The CLS institute covers 50% of the funding for the first three years of the doctoral program, while the primary advisor is paid by the main advisor.

Applicants to the fellowship are required to hold, or to be about to complete a Master's degree in a relevant field. Proof of English language proficiency is also required.

The Cyber-Defense Campus (CYD) offers a fully-funded four-year long PhD fellowship. The fellowship provides salary, research, and conference allowances. 

Applicants to this highly-exclusive fellowship must be *already* enrolled in a doctoral program at a Swiss institution and have a strong academic and/or professional record.

The ETH AI Center offers a fellowship program for doctoral students that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration. The fellowship involves co-supervision by two faculty members from different departments, in an attempt to foster interdisciplinary exchange. 

Fellows will be located at the ETH AI Center and are encouraged to pursue an entrepreneurial or industry track to gain practical experience.
