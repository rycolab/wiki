# Paper Metadata
 We keep track of all paper metadata in the [Rycolab paper Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bkwiXM3pRmWsa1NHqcKvJLsQy19HUaMz6LJ-xsjIDGM/edit?usp=sharing). This *needs* to be kept up-to-date for all of your published papers since this spreadsheet is used for important administrative tasks. The information you fill in here will be the bibtex of your paper! So make sure to fill in all the fields correctly.
 Specifically, there is a  "publication-ready" column that checks if certain criteria are fulfilled, e.g., the codebase is made public and the version on arXiv is updated to match the CR version, so make sure to go through each column in the spreadsheet.
