# Arxiving Papers

We often make our papers available on the arXiv. 
Sometimes before submission, sometimes after acceptance, and sometimes after publication.
It is a good way to keep our papers up to date.

Before arxiving a paper, make sure that all the authors are aware and agree to the arxiv version.


## Download the paper source from Overleaf
Go to the overleaf project and click on the menu button in the top left corner.
Then click on "Source" and download the zip file.


## Cleaning up the paper
Be aware that *all* latex source files will be made public on the arxiv.

Use the [arxiv cleaner](https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner) to remove all the extra files 
and comments that you do not want to show in the arxiv version.
