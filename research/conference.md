# Rycolab Conference Policies

We have a few simple rules regarding traveling to conferences.
* All travels must be approved (in advance) by Ryan, otherwise Patrizia[^1] might not be able to reimburse your travel.
* In general, the reimbursement of conference expenses is to be claimed after the respective travel, with the exception of conference fees.
If you do have financial issues and the reimbursement has to be processed quicker, you can talk to Patrizia to speed it up.
* In order to get reimbursed, it is really important to save the receipts. Whenever you pay for something, just take a picture of the receipt to make sure it doesn't get lost. It takes only 5 seconds!
* If you can, you should get reimbursed via [ETHIS](https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/finance-and-controlling/ethis.html).
Every PhD student and postdoc has access to the portal.

[^1]: Patrizia is our administrative assistant. You can contact her through email `patrizia.napoli@inf.ethz.ch` or [Zulip](../onboarding/zulip.md).

## Accommodation

ETH regulations are to reimburse for a [middle class](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/associates/services/finance-and-controlling/closed/Reisen/Hotelliste.pdf) hotel room, so when booking conference accommodation make sure you either book a room in the recommended venue or book something within the same price range.

In order to be reimbursed for accommodation expenses, you need to upload proper invoices. No booking confirmations nor any third-party receipts will be accepted.

## Transportation

For transportation you can either book it yourself and get reimbursed or book it using [AirPlus](https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/finanzen-und-controlling/reisen/airplus/airplus.html) via ETH.

For flights, you have to upload both a proper receipt and the boarding pass.

## Food

We generally do not reimburse food expenses at conferences. Why? We reimburse a lot of expenses for people who ordinarily most groups wouldn't pay for (e.g., MSc students, PhD students without papers at that conference).
The budget is finite so in order to allow everyone to go, we need to economize. 

In specific cases, Ryan might agree to cover the cost of your meals which are *not* provided by the hotel or event organizer. 
Please be honest here ðŸ™‚ 
The allowance for breakfast is 10 CHF, and for main meals 27.50 CHF. 
Make sure to pre-inform Patrizia about these expenses.
