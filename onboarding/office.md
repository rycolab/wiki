The office where people in Zürich work is at the 18th floor of the AndreasTurm, Andreasstrasse 5, 8050 Zürich.

Anyone that is a a student or an ETH employee doing research at the lab can access the building using their [ETH card](https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/service/rooms-and-buildings/schliessmanagement/elektronische-schliessung.html) 
and the access PIN. If you have just joined the lab and you cannot enter the building using your badge, double check with Patrizia
that she has granted you access.
If you are a visitor you should coordinate with your host so that they can let you in.

The main entrance to the building is on Andreastrasse, just below the big "AmdreasTurm" sign. During working hours you don't need a badge to 
enter the building, otherwhise you will have to scan your badge near the entrance door and enter your PIN. Once your are in, walk forward and you will
see six elevators. You can enter the floor you want to access and you will see on the monitor which elevator you have to take in order to get at that floor. 
When you are at the 18th floor, walk towards one of the two entrance doors and  you will see a black box where you can scan your badge and enter your PIN (during working
ours you will not have to enter the pin).
