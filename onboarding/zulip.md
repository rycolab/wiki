# Rycolab Zulip
The primary vehicle for communication among members of the lab is [Zulip](https://zulip.com/), which is a free and open-source chat platform (much like [Slack](https://slack.com/)) that we run locally on ETH Zürich servers. Because Slack has a per-person monthly payment for the premium version, using Zulip means we can invite as many members as we would like to. (Currently, our group chat has well over 200 members, most of whom are not in the lab itself; see below.) Members need to be invited to join Zulip. Once they are invited, the link is join https://zulip.rycolab.inf.ethz.ch/. It is strongly recommended, however, that everyone uses the [desktop client](https://zulip.com/apps/) (in dark mode) rather than the web interface. It leads to a much better user experience.

There are several principles behind being a good citizen in our online space. I'll outline them here. 
1. *Be courteous*. It is important that we treat each other with respect. This means no name-calling, insulting your colleagues or discriminatory language. That being said, treating someone with respect does not mean agreeing with them--specifically on scientific issues. We are brought together by our desire to do science. To do it well means every single person needs to have space to speak about the quality of work and object to decisions being made. [Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink), the preferencing of social harmony over critical thinking, is an oft-observed phenomenon in scientific structures that prevents good science from happening. All scientists need to be mindful of it.
2. *Be transparent*. When in doubt, make new channels public. It's best if all scientific discourse takes place in a public channel, i.e., it should be open to everyone including people who are not involved in the project. Indeed, all but a few channels are public. The private ones involve topics that have sensitive information, e.g., grades or admissions decisions. However, the fact that we are transparent on what we are working on does not mean that it is in any way acceptable to lurk in someone else's project channel and start working on a similar project. You should be mindful that a trust-based ecosystem takes effort from everyone to ensure that the source of inspirations is properly credited and it is on the lurker to not step on their colleagues’ toes when starting related projects. 
4. *Be hospitable*. We allow anyone to join our chat. Indeed, feel free to invite anyone you want. We strive to be transparent not only to other members of the group, but also to the wider research community. 
5. *Follow naming conventions*.  
    * π is for project. E.g. #π-parsing
    * τ is for teaching. E.g. #τ-ethz-nlp-22A
    * ω is for administrative matters. E.g. #ω-web-meister
    * α is for admissions. E.g. #α-admissions
    * κ is for conferences. E.g. #κ-emnlp2022
    * σ is for shared tasks. E.g. #σ-sigmorphon-sharedtask
    * μ is for MSc theses. E.g. #μ-theses
