## Overview

Lab meeting occurs weekly, with the exact time determined at the begining of each semester to accommodate as many peoples' schedule as possible.
Lab meeting is slotted for a 1.5 hours, although presentations need not take up that entire time. 
If a presentation is expected to take between 60-90 minutes then the presenter should sign up for the entire time.
If a presentation is expected to take between 30-45 minutes, then the presenter should sign up for a half-slot.
Lab meeting presentations should fit into one of two categories: (i) presentation of a paper that will be useful for memebrs of the lab; (ii) presentation of novel research.
Lab meeting presentations can also be workshops focused on a skill (such as figure generation, regression modeling etc.) however these types of presentations should not be the main focus of lab meeting.
Lab meeting attendence is not strictly manditory, however it is highly encouraged. 
If you are attending lab meeting, it is expected that you sign up to present at least once a semester (or once a year if there are more attendees than weeks in a semester).

Before conferences and *ACL submission deadlines, we will try to use one lab meeting slot for an abstract swap workshop and a practice poster presentation workshop.

The current lab meeting organizer is Alex. Please email him with questions, or if you would like to present.
